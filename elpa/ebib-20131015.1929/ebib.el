;;; Commentary:

;; Ebib is a BibTeX database manager that runs in GNU Emacs. With Ebib, you
;; can create and manage .bib-files, all within Emacs. It supports @string
;; and @preamble definitions, multi-line field values, searching, and
;; integration with Emacs' (La)TeX mode.

;; See the Ebib manual for usage and installation instructions.

;; The latest release version of Ebib, contact information and mailing list
;; can be found at <http://ebib.sourceforge.net>. Development sources can be
;; found at <https://github.com/joostkremers/ebib>.

;; `ebib-unbraced-p' determines if STRING is braced. Note that we cannot do
;; this by simply checking whether STRING begins with { and ends with } (or
;; begins and ends with "), because something like "{abc} # D # {efg}"
;; would then be incorrectly recognised as braced. So we need to do the
;; following: take out everything that is between braces or quotes, and see
;; if anything is left. If there is, the original string was raw, otherwise
;; it was not.
;;
;; So I first check whether the string begins with { or ". if not, we
;; certainly have a raw string. (`ebib-unbraced-p' recognises this through
;; the default clause of the `cond'.) If the first character is { or ", we
;; first take out every occurrence of backslash-escaped { and } or ", so
;; that the rest of the function does not get confused over them.
;;
;; Then, if the first character is {, i use `ebib-remove-from-string' to
;; take out every occurrence of the regex "{[^{]*?}", which translates to
;; "the smallest string that starts with { and ends with }, and does not
;; contain another {. IOW, it takes out the innermost braces and their
;; contents. Because braces may be embedded, we have to repeat this step
;; until no more balanced braces are found in the string. (Note that it
;; would be unwise to check for just the occurrence of { or }, because that
;; would throw `ebib-unbraced-p' in an infinite loop if a string contains
;; an unbalanced brace.)
;;
;; For strings beginning with " I do the same, except that it is not
;; necessary to repeat this in a while loop, for the simple reason that
;; strings surrounded with double quotes cannot be embedded; i.e.,
;; "ab"cd"ef" is not a valid (BibTeX) string, while {ab{cd}ef} is.
;;
;; Note: because these strings are to be fed to BibTeX and ultimately
;; (La)TeX, it might seem that we don't need to worry about strings
;; containing unbalanced braces, because (La)TeX would choke on them. but
;; the user may inadvertently enter such a string, and we therefore need to
;; be able to handle it. (Alternatively, we could perform a check on
