;; EBIB-DB-UNBRACED-P determines if STRING is enclosed in braces. Note that
;; we cannot do this by simply checking whether STRING begins with { and
;; ends with } (or begins and ends with "), because something like "{abc} #
;; D # {efg}" would then be incorrectly recognised as braced. So we need to
;; do the following: take out everything that is between braces or quotes,
;; and see if anything is left. If there is, the original string was
;; braced, otherwise it was not.

;; So we first check whether the string begins with { or ". if not, we
;; certainly have an unbraced string. (EBIB-DB-UNBRACED-P recognises this
;; through the default clause of the COND.) If the first character is { or
;; ", we first take out every occurrence of backslash-escaped { and } or ",
;; so that the rest of the function does not get confused over them.

;; Then, if the first character is {, EBIB-REMOVE-FROM-STRING takes out
;; every occurrence of the regex "{[^{]*?}", which translates to "the
;; smallest string that starts with { and ends with }, and does not contain
;; another {. IOW, it takes out the innermost braces and their contents.
;; Because braces may be embedded, we have to repeat this step until no
;; more balanced braces are found in the string. (Note that it would be
;; unwise to check for just the occurrence of { or }, because that would
;; throw EBIB-DB-UNBRACED-P in an infinite loop if a string contains an
;; unbalanced brace.)

;; For strings beginning with " we do the same, except that it is not
;; necessary to repeat this in a WHILE loop, for the simple reason that
;; strings surrounded with double quotes cannot be embedded; i.e.,
;; "ab"cd"ef" is not a valid (BibTeX) string, while {ab{cd}ef} is.

;; Note: because these strings are to be fed to BibTeX and ultimately
;; (La)TeX, it might seem that we don't need to worry about strings
;; containing unbalanced braces, because (La)TeX would choke on them. But
;; the user may inadvertently enter such a string, and we therefore need to
;; be able to handle it. (Alternatively, we could perform a check on
