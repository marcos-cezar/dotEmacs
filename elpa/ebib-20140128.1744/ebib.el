;;; Commentary:

;; Ebib is a BibTeX database manager that runs in GNU Emacs. With Ebib, you
;; can create and manage .bib-files, all within Emacs. It supports @string
;; and @preamble definitions, multi-line field values, searching, and
;; integration with Emacs' (La)TeX mode.

;; See the Ebib manual for usage and installation instructions.

;; The latest release version of Ebib, contact information and mailing list
;; can be found at <http://ebib.sourceforge.net>. Development sources can be
;; found at <https://github.com/joostkremers/ebib>.
